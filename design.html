            <div class="header-text">
                <p>Many of the most promising—and least controversial—uses of generative AI in film making are in the
                    area of production design. AI can be used (with varying degrees of naturalness) to generate both
                    still and moving images, as well as in the creation of concept art, animation, and visual effects.
                    In 1991, James Cameron's sci-fi epic "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" (1991) showcased groundbreaking
                    CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) effects that pushed the boundaries of what was possible with
                    computer graphics at the time.</p>
                <p>AI algorithms were instrumental in simulating the fluid movements of the iconic liquid metal T-1000
                    Terminator, laying the groundwork for future advancements in CGI technology. The use of generative
                    AI in film began with Peter Jackson's epic fantasy saga based on J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the
                    Rings" Trilogy (2001-2003). For these films, Weta Digital developed Massive to create crowd scenes
                    for battles that consisted of different kinds of “agents” with characteristic actions. When two of
                    these AI agents met in battle, the outcome was not predictable. Massive was also used to create
                    crowd simulations for the films “Avatar” (2009) and “The Avengers” (2012).</p>

                    <h2>Uses</h2>
                    <p>One use of generative AI in production design is to enhance graphics created through more
                        traditional means. In "The Avengers," production designers used CGI and AI (Masquerade) tools in
                        tandem to give Thanos recognizable emotions that would resonate with the audience. In the 2023
                        Oscar winner "Everything Everywhere All at Once," visual effects editor Evan
                        Halleck used Runway to automate tasks like rotoscoping that are time-consuming and imprecise
                        when done frame-by-frame by hand. AI also allows production designers to create and modify
                        virtual environments quickly and in real-time, which can eliminate the need for expensive
                        physical sets and time-consuming changes to those sets. In turn, by reducing the time and costs
                        associated with creating visual effects that can be automated, the use of AI gives artists the
                        space to be more creative in other directions. </p>
                    <p>Generative AI can also be used to create graphics like concept art and 3D models. AI models
                        like Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion can be used to create still images for use in
                        backgrounds and landscapes, and although the images created by these models still suffer
                        from the uncanny valley effect, they have been undergoing rapid improvement in recent years.</p>
                    <p>The most controversial use of AI in production design is the use of programs like Runway and Pika
                        Labs to create moving images from a text prompt or a reference image. However, while this
                        technology is improving quickly, it currently still struggles to present physics and anatomy in
                        natural ways. Less comprehensive uses of AI in the creation of moving images include the use of
                        AI to animate still images to make a character nod their head or appear to be talking and the
                        use of machine learning to track movement of real objects to use in the creation of naturalistic
                        motion effects. AI can also be used to create hybrids of live-action and AI-generated
                        content: this is concerning for its potential use in creating deepfakes, but is hard to do
                        convincingly with current technology.</p>

                    <h2>Concerns</h2>
                    <p>The increasing use of generative AI in production design has led to fears about job security for
                        artists and crew members, and especially for those in entry-level positions that would be
                        assigned the time-consuming hand-work that AI can automate. However, since there is also a
                        learning curve associated with the use of AI tools, it is not clear that benefits to efficiency
                        (and subsequent job losses) will be seen as quickly as they are anticipated.</p>
                    <p>There are also concerns that the ease of creating content using AI will result in a decrease in
                        the quality of work produced by the entertainment industry through the generation of visuals
                        that lack artistic merit and humanity and that create cognitive dissonance (e.g., the
                        uncanny valley). Finally, as in other areas of filmmaking, there are ethical concerns about the
                        source of the data being used to train the AI software and whether Ai-generated derivative
                        works can be copyright protected.

                <p>The above dataset portrays how generative AI can make workers more cost effective. This was measured
                    by how fast workers completed their tasks with AI vs. without AI. While it cuts down on the training
                    of employees, it also creates new tasks related to operating an AI product.</p>

                <h2>Response</h2>
                <p> Indian filmmaker Shekhar Kapur is hopeful that the use of AI will democratize the process of
                    filmmaking by making it quicker, easier, and cheaper: "If everyone has access to the same tools,
                    organisational hierarchies will break and everyone will have the power to tell a story."
